# Completing projects with the R community


A talk for R-Ladies Miami on April 22, 2021 about leveraging the R community to complete projects, inspired by the blog post [A job interview presentation inspired by the R community:
How `#tidytuesday` and twitter helped me secure a job offer](https://www.pipinghotdata.com/posts/2020-08-30-a-job-interview-presentation-inspired-by-the-r-community/).


## Abstract

_DRAFT_

Starting a new project in R can be daunting, but there are many community resources that can help! In this presentation I’ll discuss how I crafted a project for a job interview presentation that very closely mirrored existing resources. Making small modifications on existing code allowed me to complete the project in a reasonable timeline and created scaffolding for more open-ended future projects. This inspired me to give back to the R community, so I’ll also discuss how I slowly became more involved.
